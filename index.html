        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>The Great Depression was a worldwide economic downturn that began in 1929 and lasted until about 1939. It was the longest and most severe depression ever experienced by the industrialized Western world. The timing and severity of the Depression varied across countries. It was particularly long and severe in the United States and Europe, milder in Japan and much of Latin America, while some less-developed countries, such as Argentina and Brazil, experienced comparatively mild downturns. The Soviet Union was not affected by the Great Depression.</p>

        <h2>Causes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Bank failures</li>
            <li>Unequal distribution of wealth</li>
            <li>Decline of international trade</li>
            <li>Decline of farming industry</li>
            <li>Overproduction of agricultural goods and industrial products</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Effects</h2>
        <p>The Great Depression's effects were devastating, including high unemployment, widespread poverty, and homelessness. It led to massive bank and business failures, a sharp decline in industrial production and trade, and significant psychological and social impacts on families. Personal income, tax revenue, profits, and prices dropped, while international trade plunged by more than 50 percent. The crisis also triggered a major increase in government intervention in the economy and contributed to political instability in many parts of the world, with some nations turning to totalitarian regimes.</p>

            <li>Rising prices led to declining consumer purchasing power</li>
            <li>Gap between rich and poor widened</li>
            <li>Banks failed</li>
            <li>Gross national products decreased</li>
